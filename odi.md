# **Replicate Data using Oracle Data Integrator With BICC**

Note:  Thanks to Martha Aguilar for her help with setup!

Note the current V2 version of the Marketplace Image is missing the reverse engineering knowledge Module (RKM) for BICC.  You can download it [here](./KM_RKM Oracle BI Cloud Connector.xml).

### **Prerequisites**

- You have an ERP Cloud instance account that has the required priviledges to access bicc and create connections and replications (see link above for details).  Note the application version must be 19C or greater.
- You have a local (not federated) cloud userid.
- You have created a connection to object storage in BICC (see the previous option for setup).
- You have created an OCI bucket in your tenancy.

### **Log into the Oracle Business Intelligence Cloud Connector Console	and Create a Connection to Object Storage**
