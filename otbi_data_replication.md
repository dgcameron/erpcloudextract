- Select Catalog.  Note in this demo instance the current user does not have priviledges to create new reports, but permissions can be granted to create new reports on VOs that you wish to export.

- Since the current user does not have any priviledges to export data this document will switch to another environment to show how the export would be done.  This is using the [SampleApp](http://sampleappv607biapp-wikibiappsb3a-k124bbx7.srv.ravcloud.com:9502/analytics/saw.dll?bieehome&startPage=1) hosted demo environment to do this (userid/pw weblogic / Admin123).  You can select any report.  I am selecting the Dashboard - Employee Expenses.
